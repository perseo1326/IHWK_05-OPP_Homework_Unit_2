OPP Homework (Unit 2)



    LBL Trucking Company sells fleets of Trucks to large companies all over the world.
    They need new customers so they decide to offer a free webinar on the cost savings
    associated with their new hybrid trucks.

    Every person who signs up for the webinar becomes a Lead in their CRM.

    The CRM stores the name, phone number, email address, and company name of each Lead.

    Sara is a sales associate at LBL.

    After the webinar, she starts calling all the new Leads.

    The first 5 Leads are not interested.

    The sixth Lead is Mike from Emerson Produce Company.

    Mike says he is interested in learning more and would like to see their pricing.

    Sara needs to convert Mike’s Lead to an Opportunity.

    Mike’s Lead id is 134. Sara types “Convert 134” into the CRM.

    The CRM begins by creating a new Contact object with the contact information from Mike’s Lead object.

    The CRM then prompts Sara for the product that Mike is interested in (Hybrid Truck, Flatbed Truck, or Box Truck)
    and the number of trucks that he is interested in buying.

    Sara inputs the information “Hybrid Truck” and “30”.

    The CRM creates a new Opportunity object with this information.

    It adds the new Mike Contact object as the decisionMaker for the Opportunity
    and sets the status to “OPEN”.

    The CRM then prompts Sara for the industry, number of employees, city, and country of Mike’s company.

    Sara inputs the information “Produce”, “4000”, “Berlin”, “Germany”.

    The CRM takes the Company name from Mike’s Lead Object
    and creates a new Account Object with this information.

    It adds the Mike Contact to the contactList of the Account
    and the new Opportunity to the opportunityList of the Account.

    Finally the System deletes the Mike Lead.

    The next day Sara wants to look up the new Opportunity.

    The Opportunity id is 24. She types “lookup opportunity 24”.

    The CRM displays the opportunity information.

    She wants to call Mike to check on the deal.

    Unfortunately, he says they have decided to buy from another truck company.

    Sara types “close-lost 24”
    and the CRM changes the status of opportunity 24 to “CLOSED-LOST”


    ******************************************
    Requirements
    ******************************************

    For this project you must accomplish all of the following:

    1. Create a use case diagram and add it to your README.md.

    2. Create a class diagram and add it to your README.md.

    3. Create unit tests for every method other than basic getters, setters, and constructors
        (getters and setters with logic do require unit tests).

    4. Handle all exceptions gracefully (incorrect input should not crash the program).

    5. Leads can be added to the CRM by typing the command “New Lead” (case insensitive).

    6. When a new Lead is created the user will be prompted for
        name, phoneNumber, email, and companyName.
        All fields must be supplied to create the new Lead.

    7. The system should automatically create an id for the Lead.
        Your CRM should keep track of how many objects have been created and provide the current count
        as the id for each new object.

    8. A list of all Leads’ id and name can be displayed by typing “Show Leads” (case insensitive).

    9. An individual Lead’s details can be displayed by typing “Lookup Lead id” (case insensitive)
        where “id” is the actual id of the Lead to lookup.

    10. A Lead can be converted to an Opportunity by typing “convert id” (case insensitive)
        where “id” is the actual id of the Lead to convert.

    11. When a Lead is converted, a Contact will be created with the Lead contact info and a new id.

    12. When a Lead is converted, the user will be prompted for the product and
        the number of trucks for this Opportunity.
        A new Opportunity should be created with the above information and with the new Contact
        as the decisionMaker for the Opportunity and
        a status of “OPEN”.
        To recap, Opportunity should have the following properties:
            id - a unique identifier
            product - an Enum with options HYBRID, FLATBED, or BOX
            quantity - the number of trucks being considered for purchase
            decisionMaker - a Contact
            status - an Enum with options OPEN, CLOSED_WON, CLOSED_LOST (these are common sales
                terms indicating an ongoing potential sale, a sale, and an opportunity where a
                sale was not made and the sale is no longer a possibility)

    13. When a Lead is converted, the user will be prompted for
        the industry, number of employees, city, and country of the organization.
        An Account represents the company that is looking to buy a truck.
        Each Account should have a List of Contacts and a List of Opportunities.
        To recap, the Account should have the following properties:
            id - a unique identifier
            industry - an Enum with options PRODUCE, ECOMMERCE, MANUFACTURING, MEDICAL, OTHER
            employeeCount - a number representing the number of employees in the company
            city - a String
            country - a String
            contactList - a List of Contacts associated with this Account
            opportunityList - a list of Opportunities associated with this Account

    14. Leads are removed from the system once they have been successfully converted.

    15. Opportunity status can be edited using the command “close-lost id” or “close-won id”
        where “id” is the id of the Opportunity that should be closed.

    Note: For simplicity, Lead, Account, and Contact information cannot be updated once the object has been created.

    Note: For simplicity, there is currently no way to associate multiple Contacts or Opportunities with
        a single Account. These should still be Lists as we will be adding more functionality to
        this application in the future.
